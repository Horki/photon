## Reporting a Vulnerability

We are using [GitHub Security Advisories](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/getting-started/adding-a-security-policy-to-your-repository) to privately discuss, fix, and publish information about the vulnerabilities.


### Responsible Disclosure Policy

We request that you provide us with a reasonable amount of time to resolve the issue before you disclose it publicly. We also request that you make a good faith effort to avoid privacy violations, data loss, and service disruption while investigating vulnerabilities.



Thank you for helping us make our project more secure!
